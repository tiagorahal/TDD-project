# TDD project

> This is a project built using test-driven development

I built the folowing methods using TDD:

- A method called factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the factorial for that number.
- A method called reverse that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed.
- a method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
  - When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
  - When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
  - When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
  - Any other case, return N as a string.
